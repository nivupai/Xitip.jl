# Proofs and counterexamples

[`prove`](@ref) answers `true` or `false`. [`explain`](@ref) answers with a
[`Result`](@ref), which carries the reason: a [`Proof`](@ref) for each part of a
true statement (an equality has two, one per direction), or a single
[`Counterexample`](@ref).

Both kinds of certificate are verified in exact rational arithmetic before they
are returned, so a printed proof is not a plausible-looking summary of a
floating point computation: it is the object that was checked.

## Proofs

A proof writes the statement as a non-negative combination of basic
inequalities and constraints:

```@example proofs
using Xitip

result = explain("H(X,Y,Z) <= H(X,Y) + H(Z)")
```

```@example proofs
proof = only(result.certificates)
proof.terms
```

### Step by step

[`print_proof`](@ref) shows the same proof as a chain of equalities. Each line
splits one non-negative quantity off the expression; the bracket holds what is
still to account for, and the last line has nothing left:

```@example proofs
print_proof(result)
```

Reading it:

* `E` is the statement written as entropies, with everything moved to one side.
  Where `E` is a single information quantity, that name is shown as well — here
  `I(X,Y;Z)`.
* Each chain line is an identity, not an assumption: the terms so far plus the
  bracket always equal `E`.
* The list below the chain gives the entropy form of every term, so each line
  can be checked by hand without expanding definitions.
* The last chain line is the conclusion: `E` is a sum of non-negative
  quantities.

A remainder that happens to be a single quantity is named, which is what turns
`H(Y) + H(Z) - H(Y,Z)` into `I(Y;Z)` above. The shapes recognised are `H(A)`,
`H(A|B)`, `I(A;B)` and `I(A;B|C)`, including positive multiples of them.

### Constraints in a proof

Constraints appear as `C1`, `C2`, ... in the chain, with their own text beside
their entropy form:

```@example proofs
print_proof(explain("I(X;Z) <= I(X;Y)", "X/Y/Z"))
```

A statement can imply several relations — a Markov chain implies one per link —
so a term reads "from constraint 1" rather than "constraint 1". An equality
constraint used in the other direction is marked "reversed".

A constraint is not non-negative for any obvious reason, so the list says why
it is. Here `C1` is minus a conditional mutual information, which is
non-negative only because the Markov chain forces that information to zero:

```
C1 = H(X) - H(W,X) - H(X,Y) + H(W,X,Y)  =  -I(W;Y|X)  = 0
```

A constraint written as an inequality is simply `>= 0`, and an elemental
inequality is non-negative by definition, so neither needs more.

### LaTeX

[`latex`](@ref) writes a proof for a paper. By default it is the identity
alone, which is usually what a paper wants:

```@example proofs
latex(result)
```

`steps=true` gives the full chain, and `expand=true` adds the entropy form of
every term (constraints are always listed, since the chain would otherwise
refer to something invisible):

```@example proofs
latex(result; steps=true, expand=true)
```

The output needs `amsmath`. Long expressions are wrapped to stay inside the
page margin; the package's own test suite compiles the output with `pdflatex`
where a TeX installation is available and fails on an overfull line.

[`latex_string`](@ref) returns the same text as a `String`.

## Counterexamples

When a statement cannot be proven, the certificate is a counterexample: entropy
values satisfying every basic inequality and every constraint, but not the
statement.

```@example proofs
explain("I(X;Y|Z) <= I(X;Y)")
```

The values are exact rationals, rounded to small numbers where possible, and
can be read off the [`Counterexample`](@ref):

```@example proofs
counter = only(explain("H(X) <= H(Y)").certificates)
counter.entropies        # indexed by subset bitmask: 1 = X, 2 = Y, 3 = X,Y
```

The printed counterexample ends with the same reading: what each side of the
statement comes to there, and how every quantity gets its value out of the
entropies above it.

### Reading the numbers

The values are **entropies in bits**, not probabilities: they are bounded by the
logarithm of the alphabet size, not by 1. `H(X) = 6` describes a variable with
up to 64 equally likely values, and `H(X,Y,Z) = 13` a triple with up to 8192.

`direction = true` marks the case where the values are not a point but a
direction: the statement has no constant term, so every positive multiple of
the values fails in the same way, and the small integers printed are just the
most readable representative. Dividing by the largest of them is equally
valid:

```@example proofs
table = entropy_table(explain("I(X;Y|Z) <= I(X;Y)"))
peak = maximum(last, table)
[k => Float64(v // peak) for (k, v) in table]
```

What matters is the relations between them. For the table above,

```math
I(X;Y) = H(X) + H(Y) - H(X,Y), \qquad
I(X;Y \mid Z) = H(X,Z) + H(Y,Z) - H(Z) - H(X,Y,Z),
```

and the second is the larger, which is why `I(X;Y|Z) <= I(X;Y)` fails.
Conditioning really can raise mutual information, and it does so in an
everyday distribution: let `X` and `Y` be independent fair bits and `Z = X`
xor `Y`. Then

```@example proofs
prove("I(X;Y|Z) <= I(X;Y)", "I(X;Y) = 0", "H(Z|X,Y) = 0", "H(X|Y,Z) = 0")
```

is still not provable, because those constraints describe exactly that
distribution, where `I(X;Y) = 0` while `I(X;Y|Z) = 1` bit.

!!! note "A counterexample is a polymatroid, not necessarily a distribution"
    Beyond three variables, not every vector satisfying the basic inequalities
    comes from an actual probability distribution. A counterexample therefore
    shows that the statement does not follow from the basic inequalities — it
    does not show the statement is false. The Zhang–Yeung inequality is true,
    yet correctly reported as not provable here.

## When it is not provable: what would make it true

A counterexample says the statement does not follow from the basic
inequalities. It does not say the statement is useless — most information
inequalities in practice hold *under assumptions*.
[`sufficient_conditions`](@ref) looks for those assumptions.

```@example proofs
sufficient_conditions("I(X;Y|Z) <= I(X;Y)")
```

Conditioning can raise mutual information, so the statement is false in
general. It becomes provable the moment any one of the three pairs is
conditionally independent — two of those readings being the Markov chains
`X/Y/Z` and `Y/X/Z`, which is the familiar fact that along a Markov chain
conditioning cannot help.

The candidate assumptions are the elemental quantities, each forced to
zero. That is a deliberate choice rather than a convenience: every
elemental quantity reads as a condition one would state out loud — an
independence, a conditional independence, or a functional dependence — so
every answer is something you can say in words, and the constraint text
printed beside it can be fed straight back in:

```@example proofs
prove("I(X;Y|Z) <= I(X;Y)", "I(X;Z|Y) = 0")
```

Assumptions can be combined. Some statements need two:

```@example proofs
sufficient_conditions("2H(X,Y,Z) <= H(X,Y) + H(Y,Z)"; maxsize = 2)
```

and some have nothing that saves them:

```@example proofs
sufficient_conditions("H(X) + H(Y) + H(Z) <= H(X,Y,Z)"; maxsize = 2)
```

Only minimal sets are reported: once an assumption works on its own, no
pair containing it is offered.

### How the search is kept small

The number of candidates is the number of elemental inequalities, which
grows quickly — 9 for three variables, 28 for four, 1800 for eight — and
combining them squares that. Two things keep it in hand.

The first is the counterexample. If a quantity is **already zero** at the
counterexample, assuming it is zero leaves that counterexample exactly
where it was, so that assumption cannot possibly help. Only quantities that
are strictly positive there are worth trying, and a combination is worth
trying only when at least one of its members is. This is a sound rule, not
a heuristic, and the test suite checks it against brute force over every
candidate: the pruned search returns exactly the same answers.

The second is plain book-keeping: `limit` caps how many sets are reported
and `budget` caps how many statements are proven, so a large problem
returns something useful rather than running away. The printed result says
when the search stopped early.

Each answer is verified the ordinary way — by proving the statement again
with the assumption added — so a reported condition is one the prover
accepts, not one the search believes.

## Results without a certificate

If the exact simplex fallback had to decide (which the test suite has never
observed over thousands of random problems), the verdict stands but
`certificates` is empty:

```@example proofs
explain("H(X,Y) <= H(X) + H(Y)"; method=:simplex)
```
