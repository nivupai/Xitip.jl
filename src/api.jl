    ProofStep

One step of a step-by-step proof: `coefficient` times the non-negative
quantity `name` is split off the expression, leaving `remainder`. So

    expression so far  =  coefficient * name  +  remainder

`expansion` is the quantity written with entropies, `label` is how it is
written in the chain of equalities (a short `C1` for a constraint, whose
text is then in `source`), and `remainder_name` is the remainder as a
single information quantity where it is one.

`named` is the quantity itself under a name where it has one — an equality
constraint used in reverse is the negation of one, as in `-I(W;Y|X)` — and
`justification` says why it is non-negative: `">= 0"` for an inequality,
`"= 0"` for an equality constraint.

    Counterexample

Why an information expression could not be proven: entropy values `h`
satisfying every elemental inequality and every constraint, but not the
expression itself. Such an `h` need not come from an actual probability
distribution: beyond three variables not every polymatroid is entropic, so
the expression may still be a (non-Shannon-type) truth.

`direction` marks the degenerate case where `h` is not a point but a
direction along which the expression decreases without bound.

    prove(lines...; method=:auto) -> Bool

Check whether the first statement is a Shannon-type consequence of the
remaining ones (the constraints). `false` means the statement is either
false or a non-Shannon-type inequality. Throws `XitipError` for
contradictory constraints and `SyntaxError` for invalid input.

Every result is exact: `method=:auto` finds a proof or a counterexample
with non-negative least squares and verifies it in exact rational
arithmetic (falling back to the exact simplex method); `method=:simplex`
uses the exact simplex method only, which is much slower beyond about 7
variables.

See [`explain`](@ref) to get the proof or counterexample itself.

```julia

TRUE
Proof of  H(X) + H(Y) - H(X,Y) >= 0:
